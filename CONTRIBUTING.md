## ✏️ Fixing Typos

Found a small typo or grammar mistake? No problem! You can edit these directly on GitHub, as long as you’re working with the right files:

- ✅ **YES**: Edit docstrings or comments in Python files located in the `src/` directory.
- ❌ **NO**: Do not edit auto-generated files or build artifacts (like files in `docs/` or `dist/`).

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before jumping into a big pull request (PR), let’s make sure we’re all on the same page:

- 🐞 **Found a bug?** File an issue first and include a minimal example showing the problem. Bonus points for using a code snippet! 📜
- ✨ **Proposing a feature?** Open an issue and share your idea! Let’s discuss it before you spend time coding.

Collaboration is key! 🧑‍🤝‍🧑

## 🚧 Pull Request Process

Here’s how to submit a great PR:  

1. **📂 Branch Management**:  
   - Create a new branch for each PR (e.g., `fix/typo-description`, `feature/add-heart-check`).  
   - Keep your changes focused on a single fix or feature.

2. **📏 Code Style**:  
   - Follow the [PEP8 style guide](https://pep8.org/). Tools like `flake8`, or `pylint` are your best friends. 🖤  
   - Keep your code clean and consistent!

3. **📖 Documentation**:  
   - Update docstrings, README files, or tutorial notebooks to reflect your changes.  
   - Use clear and concise language that’s easy to follow. ✍️

4. **💌 Submitting a PR**:  
   - Link your PR to an issue using keywords like “Closes #123.”  
   - Provide a description of your changes, why you made them, and any trade-offs involved.
